<b>About Me</b><br/><br/>
<p>My first name is Fatemeh, and my nickname is Saba :)

I'm a software developer with 3 years of full-time experience in frontend development, plus 2 years of part-time learning during my software engineering studies at university. I started getting into frontend tech back in college, and it laid the groundwork for my career.

I improved at it while working with startup teams, helping build websites using HTML5, CSS3, SASS, and JavaScript. But I really found my passion when I started using React and React Native. These technologies clicked with me because they make creating efficient and user-friendly web and mobile apps easy.

Outside work, I like to keep learning by doing personal projects in my free time.

I aim to keep pushing the envelope in front-end development, especially in mobile applications, and make great user experiences in my future work. I'm looking forward to contact with you.</p>
